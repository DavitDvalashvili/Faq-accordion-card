## My process
It is my very first project with javascript, Maybe there are some features that need to enhance but I think it's normal, while working on this project it was pretty hard for me to change html element's styles from javascript code while event occurs, but this time I coped with that challenge quite well.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
